# Switching to Sematic Versioning 

We are excited to fully switch to sematic versioning in our repostories. 
Instead of relying on pushing to main and updating the version by hand from now on a tag will be released for newer versions.

We have started the process of adding our code to tags and release a change log, but this is going to take a couple days to do.
So please be patient all of the tags are already out just need to add release notes.

I hope you like this update and hopefully minecraft-essentails continues to strive, I have a couple teasers for the next update `0.2.12`

- Minecraft essentials has supported node in experientmental and switched to cargo workspaces
- Implementation of mod platforms apis.
and more to come in `0.2.12` so stay tuned for the next update.
