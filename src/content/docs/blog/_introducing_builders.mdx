# Welcome to the new Auth Builders and Launcher Builders!

We are excited to announce the release of the new Auth Builders and Launcher Builders.

These builders make it easier to create Authentication and Launching Minecraft required for your Client launcher.

Here is a quick example of the auth builder:

```Rust

use minecraft_auth::{AuthenticationBuilder, AuthType, CustomAuthData}

let mut auth = AuthenticationBuilder::builder();
let client_secret = "keep this secret safe";

auth.of_type(AuthType::Oauth) // Change this to device code if you want to use that
    .client_id("6a6bf548-5a82-41f5-9451-88b334cdc77")
    .client_secret(&client_secret)
    .bedrockrel(Some(false));
let auth_info = auth.get_info().await;
println!("Authenifcation get_info {:?}", auth_info);

println!("Authentication info: {:?}", auth.launch().await?);
```
